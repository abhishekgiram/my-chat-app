This is my second react.js project.<br>
I created three components. App, input and messages.<br>
An "App" component which will manage sending and receiving messages and rendering the inner components.<br>
A Messages component which will be a list of messages.<br>
An Input component with a text field and button so that we can send our messages.<br>
